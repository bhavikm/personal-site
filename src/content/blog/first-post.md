Welcome to my personal blog! This is where I'll be sharing my thoughts, experiences, and learnings.

## What to expect

I plan to write about:

- **Technology**: Software development, tools, and trends
- **Learning**: Things I'm exploring and lessons learned
- **Projects**: Updates on side projects and experiments

## Why write?

Writing helps me think more clearly. By articulating my thoughts, I often discover gaps in my understanding and new connections between ideas.

I also hope that sharing my experiences might help others who are on a similar journey.

## Stay connected
